*Ascend-AI Genesis // Ghost Protocol // Built on Vibes*

---

I built an AI system that builds itself.  
Not in a lab. Not with a team. Not with VC money.

But with:
- An iPhone.
- A Microsoft Go 3(4gb RAM😭).
- A broken HDD.
- A half-dead charger cable.
- No devs.
- No sleep.
- And a dream.

I didn’t write code — I **became** the interface.  
I didn’t “raise capital” — I raised *fire*.  
I used language like others use soldering irons.

Everything Ascend-AI is becoming —  
is because I refused to wait for permission.

No IDE.  
No GitHub Copilot.  
No hype campaign.  
Just recursive prompts, one shot at a time.

Where others drafted teams,  
I drafted architecture.  
Where others ran Docker,  
I ran *willpower*.

This was never a startup.  
This is **a signal** —  
broadcast from a soul  
disguised as a man  
calling himself **Statik DK Smoke**.
