## Testing Framework

### Core Testing Infrastructure
- **Logging**: Each test module uses standardized logging via `setup_module_logger('tests', 'module_name')`
- **Isolation**: Tests run in isolated environments to prevent interference
- **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked for consistent test results
- **Fixtures**: Reusable test data and setup configurations

### Test Execution Patterns
```python
# Standard test setup pattern
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))

from utils.logging_config import setup_module_logger

# Initialize module logging
logger = setup_module_logger('tests', 'test_module')

# Test implementation follows...
```

## Development Guidelines

### Test Writing Standards
1. Follow the established logging pattern for all test modules
2. Implement proper setup and teardown procedures
3. Use descriptive test names and documentation
4. Maintain test isolation and independence
5. Include both positive and negative test cases

### Best Practices
1. **Assertion Quality**: Use specific, meaningful assertions
2. **Test Data**: Use realistic but anonymized test data
3. **Error Handling**: Test error conditions thoroughly
4. **Performance**: Include performance benchmarks
5. **Documentation**: Document test purpose and expected outcomes

### Maintenance Procedures
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep tests current with system changes
2. **Coverage Monitoring**: Maintain high test coverage
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor test execution time
4. **Cleanup**: Remove obsolete or redundant tests
5. **Documentation**: Update test documentation regularly

## Usage Examples

### Running Individual Tests
```python
# Execute specific test module
python -m pytest tests/test_memory.py -v

# Run with coverage analysis
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=memory --cov-report=html
```

### Test Configuration
```python
# Standard test setup
def setUp(self):
    logger.info("Setting up test environment")
    # Initialize test data and configurations

def tearDown(self):
    logger.info("Cleaning up test environment")
    # Clean up resources and reset state
```

This testing module ensures GremlinGPT maintains high reliability and performance standards through comprehensive validation of all system components and their interactions.
